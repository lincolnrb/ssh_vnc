= Preface

I'm sure there are a lot of ways this can be improved.
Feel free to make any modifications you'd like.  I only took
about 30 minutes to write this, so I am sure there's a lot
that can be cleaned up.

= Intention

* keep track of our various VNC machines
* make it easy to start a ssh+vnc tunnel

= To Use

Edit ssh_vnc.rb to include your target VNC servers
1. From terminal: ruby ssh_vnc.rb
2. select the tunnel to set up
3. Start your favorite VNC Client and point to localhost, display 0, 
with the password of your target vnc server
4. When finished, close your VNC client and hit enter in the 
terminal and the script will try to close it for you.
